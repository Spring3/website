title: Hello

My name is _Daniel_. I'm a Node.js and React developer.

At **Contentful** I am working on developing the Headless CMS that rocks. We deliver the best UX and are API-first, letting our customers concentrate their efforts on building and managing their product, while we handle the rest. Primarily, I concentrate on React based web applications with a Node.js, RabbitMQ, GraphQL based backend infrastructure.

To learn more about my experience, [see my CV](/cv).
