My name is _Daniel_. I'm a Node.js and React developer.

Currently, at **Contentful** I am working on the Headless CMS that rocks. We deliver the best UX and are API-first, letting our customers concentrate their efforts on building their product, that pipes it's content through one of our APIs. Primarily, I concentrate on React based web applications with a Node.js, RabbitMQ, GraphQL based backend infrastructure.
