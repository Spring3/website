My name is _Daniel_. I'm a Node.js and React developer.

At **Contentful** I am working on the Headless CMS that rocks. It is API first and aims to deliver the best UX, letting our customers concentrate their efforts on building their product, while we handle the content and delivery. Primarily I focus on React based web applications with a Node.js, RabbitMQ, GraphQL based backend infrastructure.

To learn more about my experience, [see my CV](/cv).
