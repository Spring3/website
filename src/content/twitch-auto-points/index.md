Not that I cared for the channel points, but that button just kept appearing and was triggering me. So, instead of getting an existing one, I of course created this browser extension to automatically click it and gather the channel points for me!

Spent a couple of weeks to save 2 seconds. Hey, but I learnt how extensions are made :)

- Works in multiple tabs and windows at the same time.
- Optimized for performance
- Only works on twitch websites and gets automatically disabled on other websites
- No data collection watsoever
- Updated to work with the latest twitch UI
