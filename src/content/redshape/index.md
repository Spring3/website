A time tracker for [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org) with extra client app features. Built on [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron).

Re-designs the way tasks, task information, tracked time and communication on the ticket is done on Redmine.

Was used by me and some of my former coworkers as a silent protest against the uncomfortable overcomplicated Redmine UI.
