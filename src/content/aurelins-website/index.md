A website that I designed for my sister, hoping she would use it to showcase her 3d modelling portfolio. The aim was to create a really artistic place, rich with animation and UI made with taste, as well as provide an ability to render the models live on the web page.

Frankly, by the time this website was done, my sister gave up making 3d models and never used this website. Is there a hidden correlation? That I don't know. But in order to have some pictures, I had to get the content from open source.

Good job, sis -\_-"
