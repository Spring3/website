A website that I designed for my sister, hoping she would use it to showcase her 3d modelling portfolio.

The aim was to create a place to showcase it with an ability to render the models live on the web page.

Frankly, never used by my sister, hence unfinished. The pictures and models displayed on the website are taken from open source.
