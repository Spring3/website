A website that I am making for my sister. It is going to be a place where she will put her portfolio work - images and 3d models. Ideally the aim was to create a really artistic place, rich with animation and UI made with taste, as well as provide an ability to render the models live on the web page.

Frankly my sister never used this website, so all the content that you see there was taken from open source websites and was not created by my sister.
