A link aggregator for Slack workspace. Once my coworkers were posting many useful links on slack and the idea was born to make a slack bot, that would gather them together and then give an easy access to them at any time to any person.

If you, as me, are the person who keeps open dozens of browser windows with hundreds of open tabs, you probably understand why that idea didn't work and was abandoned.

The screenshot, that you see, was the quick concept of how I imagined the landing for the dashboard. The stars were animated and rotated around the moon.

Looked awesome, believe me.

This project was not finished due to many similar projects already available. It is now archived
