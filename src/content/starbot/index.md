A link aggregator for Slack workspace. Ever had a feeling like someone posted a really interesting link but you didn't have time to read it at that same moment? This project provides you a slack bot and a dashboard at the same place. 

Save the links and get the cli command set to get the results. Or use the dashboard that is provided out of the box.

**This project is not yet complete and is a Work In Progress. The source of the project is a subject to change.**
