In one of the companies I worked at, we had a channel where people posted links to different interesting materials. It was really hard to keep up with them and manage, so I got an idea of making a link aggregator bot for slack.

Unfortuantely, as it turned out that there have been several link agregators already, I decided not to put any more effort into my alternative of this project.

Lessons learnt: market research is important. 

The screenshot, that you see how the landing page looked like.
