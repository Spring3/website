A link aggregator for Slack workspace. Ever had a feeling like someone posted a really interesting link but you didn't have time to read it at that same moment? This project provides you a slack bot and a dashboard at the same place.

Save the links and get the cli command set to get the results. Or use the dashboard that is provided out of the box.

**This project is not finished due to many similar projects already available. It is now archived**
